This repository includes processing script for wrangling and analyzing Clear Lake HABs data, biological and physical.  

## Workflow

1) There are two data sets that were downloaded from WQX that contain "biological" and "physical" data. In actuality, these files are extremely similar, and there is only some data that is not the same between them. If we could compile these into one sheet that would be amazing.
1) There are some units and names that are different between different stations, and it would be nice to convert their names and units so they were uniform across stations
1) The only lake discharge data available was given in 15-minute increments from 2007. If you know of a way to automate the condensing of this into a daily or weekly value, that would save a lot of time!
1) Once we have combined the data and it is uniform, we hope to make some basic risk assessment model
